# doom-main-menu-react

My first React "project" that was supposed to be a part of a DOOM Arena Project, a first person shooter working in your browser. Project was abandoned later on because of a jittery movement that I just couldn't fix (if anyone wants to check why movement is so uneven after some play-time, please let me know ❤️) 
Will add link to "playable" version of DOOM Arena Project later

# What's in a repo?
A simple DOOM 2016-styled main menu featuring level select, settings and a simple readme page. You can't actually play any of the levels :( 

# How to launch
Run these commands in project's directory
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
